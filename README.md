## Bar Chart of Senator Ages: Oldest to Youngest
- https://creative-exercise-macerritosz.glitch.me
- I used D3.js to display the ages of sitting US senators from oldest to youngest using the example horizontal bar chart
- https://observablehq.com/@d3/horizontal-bar-chart/2
- Using the data fetched, I was able to use the birthday data to calculate the age of the Senator and sort it from oldest to youngest
- I scaled up the resulting svg in order to allow for better readability
